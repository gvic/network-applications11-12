            <p> These Terms of Service (the "Agreement") describe the terms and conditions under which the PicUp service (the "Service") is offered. By using the service, you accept these Terms of Use and agree to be legally bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. <br />We may amend or modify these terms and conditions without notice, effective immediately, by posting such terms and conditions on the PicUp Web site or by otherwise notifying you of such terms and conditions. We reserve the right to discontinue, on a temporary or permanent basis, the Service (in whole or in part) without notice and without liability to the User. If you use the PicUp Service after we post changes to these terms and conditions, you accept the changed terms and conditions. Any amendments will be effective when posted or sent. </p>
            <p>We provide the service and data storage based on your selections.</p>
            <p>We may terminate this Agreement immediately for (a) you breach this Agreement, (b) you infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, (c) we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us. At our option, instead of termination, we may remove some or all of your content from our servers or otherwise suspend your access to your Account. Following termination, we may remove some or all of your information on our servers or elect to retain it, at our sole option.</p>
            <p>Your content shall not: (a) infringe any third party's intellectual property or publicity/privacy rights; (b) violate any law or regulation; (c) contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancel bots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information. You may not distribute unsolicited commercial messages through this service or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure. </p>
            <p>Due to the existing legal and technical environment of the Internet, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be unexpectedly disclosed. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose your private communications to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you or private communications by you to law enforcement or other government officials, as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.</p>
            <p>Any disputes arising out of the Terms will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales (or the laws of Scotland or Northern Ireland if you live there). If you choose to bring proceedings in connection with the Terms you must do so in the courts of England and Wales unless you live in Scotland or Northern Ireland, in which case you can choose to bring proceedings there.</p>
